# ************************************************ Scenario: Save, Load and Transfer Docker Image *************************************************

One of the DevOps team members was working on to create a new custom docker image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. He is done with his changes and image is saved on same server with name apps:xfusion. Recently a requirement has been raised by a team to use that image for testing, but the team wants to test the same on App Server 3. So we need to provide them that image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.

a. On App Server 1 save the image apps:xfusion in an archive.

b. Transfer the image archive to App Server 3.

c. Load that image archive on App Server 3 with same name and tag which was used on App Server 1.

Note: Docker is already installed on both servers; however, if its service is down please make sure to start it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:

1. Login on   App server as root user

2. List the existing images in docker which need to archive
docker images

3. save the image apps:xfusion in an archive 
docker save -o /tmp/apps_xfusion apps:xfusion

4. Copy the tar file on Stapp03 app server
scp /tmp/apps_xfusion banner@stapp03:/tmp/

5. Login on  Stapp03 app server & switch to root user

6. Go to tmp folder and confirm the tar file copied successfully 

7. Start Docker service if its not active

systemctl status docker
systemctl start docker
systemctl status docker

8. Load that image archive 
docker load -i /tag/apps_xfusion.tar

9. Validate the task by docker images
docker images

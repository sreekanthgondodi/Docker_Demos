# ************************************************** Scenario: Docker Volumes Mapping *************************************************************

The Nautilus DevOps team is testing applications containerization, which issupposed to be migrated on docker container-based environments soon. In today's stand-up meeting one of the team members has been assigned a task to create and test a docker container with certain requirements. Below are more details:


a. On App Server 2 in Stratos DC pull ubuntu image (preferably latest tag but others should work too).

b. Create a new container with name official from the image you just pulled.

c. Map the host volume /opt/data with container volume /usr/src/. There is an sample.txt file present on same server under /tmp; copy that file to /opt/data. Also please keep the container in running state.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:

1. Login App2a server
2. Pull the ubuntu image
sudo docker pull ubuntu:latest 

3. Run a docker container with the name specified in the question using the image you just pulled. Since, you need to keep the container running, you need to use the option -it. Also make sure you are mapping the correct local directory to the directory path in the container (In this example, /opt/sysops is mapped to /usr/src on the container): 
sudo docker run --name apps -v /opt/data:/usr/src/ -d -it ubuntu:latest

4.Make sure container is running: 
sudo docker ps

5.Finally, copy the file mentioned in the question to the local directory you mapped to the container: 
cp /tmp/sample.txt /opt/sysops/

6.Verification
Check that the file you copied in the last step can be seen in the container: 
sudo docker -it apps ls /usr/src

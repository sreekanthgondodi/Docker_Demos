# *********************************************** Scenario: Write a Docker Compose File *********************************************************

# The Nautilus application development team shared static website content that needs to be hosted on the httpd web server using a containerized platform. The team has shared details with the DevOps team, and we need to set up an environment according to those guidelines. Below are the details:


# a. On App Server 1 in Stratos DC create a container named httpd using a docker compose file /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml (please use the exact name for file).

# b. Use httpd (preferably latest tag) image for container and make sure container is named as httpd; you can use any name for service.

# c. Map 80 number port of container with port 5004 of docker host.

# d. Map container's /usr/local/apache2/htdocs volume with /opt/data volume of docker host which is already there. (please do not modify any data within these locations).

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Step 1: Save this file as docker-compose.yml in the required directory
# Step 2: Run `docker-compose up`. Wait for the container to be up.
# Step 3: Verify: Open another terminal and run `curl http://localhost:3002`
#        You should get a valid HTML content back
#
